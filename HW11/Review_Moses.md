Review:

The plot changes the size of the data points which makes viewing the data when overlayed easier, but it uses the same color palette, which is not super color-blind friendly. I am able to read the data easier in the updated version, but there would still be ambiguity in the plot for someone with deuteranopia (red-green color-blind), as they would not be able to easily discern the red and green datapoints apart from one another. The error bars in the data are easier to read, which does help convey the data as well. Reducing the size of the data points helps the error bars stand out more, and it reduces the loudness of the graph, which was previously rather distracting. There is no distortion currently being caused by the data, but without gridlines, its hard to see exactly where each data point is located in the plot and they can appear to shuffle slightly if not careful, especially in the middle of the plot when not near either axis. The plot could use a title and caption, which may be included outside of the image, but was not listed in the file for direct review.

With respect to Tufte's 5 rules, there are changes in the plot that improve these. The effect size was changed from greater to 1 to approximately 1, where the data points themselves no longer dwarf the error bars or the fitted curves. The data to ink ration is stayed strong, where the amount of data presented is easily discernible without having to clarify everything directly. There is no junk in the plot that distracts from the data itself, and the data is not repeated pointlessly anywhere.

Bad Plot:

Caption not provided with above plot. Otherwise, this plot is very noisy and is hard to determine what the emphasis is on from the plot. There are a lot of different colors with poor constrast, and color gradients that are more for aesthetics than are actually useful. There are a lot of labels included as well, which decreases the data/ink ration substantially. The effect size is actually good here, as nothing is exaggerated within the plot. The amin issue is just the amount of content that can make it hard to decipher.
