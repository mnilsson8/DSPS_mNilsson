I decided to take the class because while I've definitely worked in data science in the research I did as an undergraduate, I hope to gain an actual comprehensive higher-level understanding of data science through this class.

I am particularly interested in learning how to communicate the information learned from data.

I think a strength in my background that will help me in this class is that I have a good amount of python experience and I know I am an expert at looking up documentation. Even if I don't know the answer, I am confident that I will be able to find it.
