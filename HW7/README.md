This homework was completed by Ally Badelli, Zhouran Gao, and Mathilda Nilsson. 
Zhuoran completed tasks 3 and 4 for homework 7, scaling the numerical columns of the happiness data and plotting scatterplots for each category 
and each scaling. Ally completed tasks 5 and 6, using KMeans clustering to cluster the happiness report data, and then plotted the happiness scores 
against the cluster it was grouped in. Mathilda completed task 7, plotting the intracluster variances for KMeans clusters, for a range of 
numbers of clusters, 2-7. Mathilda realized that the plots looked different depending on the scaling method at 10:30 pm on Wednesday 
and updated the plot to show the curve for the standardized data, the min-max scaled data, and the unscaled data.
