I altered a plot from HW 5, which shows the different line models plotted against the magnitude of the GRB over log time. I removed the gray outlines around the plotted points in order to reduce the amount of ink on the plot, and because I also reduced the alpha of the points, which meant the outlines were no longer as necessary to distinguish between the points. I also made the points smaller so that there would no longer be points with error bars shorter than the diameter of the dot. Finally, I added the unit for time on the plot.

This is my good plot, from http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adafa4. It compares the color-magnitude trend for observed green pea galaxies compared to non-green pea galaxies, for two different colors. For the color measured using two UV filters, there is less of a difference in the trends between green peas and no green peas, but for the NUV-g color, the green peas showed a flatter trend compared to the non-green pea galaxies, where brighter galaxies were redder. I thought this was a good plot because it had no chart junk and a high-data to ink ratio. It made use of transparencies and I appreciated that the black trend line was for the non-green pea galaxies which were also plotted in black, while the green trend line was for the green pea galaxies which were plotted in green. I also thought that including the error through the use of a point showing the average error on the green peas in the corner of the graph. This, however, only works if the error on your points comes from the same source and doesn't have much variance in error.

This is my bad plot, from http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acb99c/pdf. It plots green pea galaxies, green pea candidate AGNs, and green pea candidate AGNS with variability in the mid-infrared in a color-color space. The galaxy points are overlaid a diagram of the locations of different categories of galaxies within the space. I think this plot is a bad plot because the underlying image is very distracting. The image is of lower quality compared to the axes of the plot and the points in the plot, and it seems to be at a low opacity. It makes it hard to read the plot, especially since the overlaid points are fully opaque, which means they obscure the text underneath. The plot is supposed to show what category of gaalxies the green pea candidate AGNs fall into, except it's hard to read that text.
