Alex Bruce Review of mNilsson HW 9

Old plot:<img width="856" height="847" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b93dd51-d4bc-49db-af81-16b6c24c85c1" />

New plot:<img width="856" height="847" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bbbb4c-32fc-4e3b-9b5e-84e079c5c899" />

Looking at the changes made to this plot, I do not think this plot had amiguity issues, besides a missing title. I think distortion was addressed here. The points that are circles (with their errorbars) were changed to be smaller <br>
and semi transparent. I think this helps the understanding of the plot by making the data points more accurate and especially the transparency helping the issue of overlapping points. <br>
I do not see any distraction problems with this plot before or after from the small amount of features.

The effect size is 1, which is ideal. The axes are labeled appropriately and the separation between values is consistent, so there is no scale manipulation. <br>
I think the key is enough to explain the components of the graph. Only thing that could be better is that the Normal Equation line is covered by another line, so making <br>
the covering line dotted would allow for every line to be seen. All the changes in colors are useful and labeled. This plot shows the whole dataset behavior, so small changes <br>
are not really necessary. The data's 2 dimensional data is straightforward and readable.

Here is the image with a color blindness affect on it (deuteraniopia):

This image would be difficult to differentiate the colors of the data points for most forms of color blindness. Knowing the context of the plot and that the lines is the most important <br>
takeaway from the plot makes me not worry too much about this too mucg. A color blindness palette could be applied to the data points which could help. <br>

Here is the found bad plot:

This plot has many issues visually. The labels on the image are sometimes unclear on what zone it is referring too. There are too many colors that will not be colorblind friendly. The text that is on the plot is covered by more data, <br>
too many components are on this plot. I do not understand what the red square represents and do not agree with the choice to make the data points stars.
